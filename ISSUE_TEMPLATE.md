Thanks for using react-virtualized! Here are a couple of things to consider before filing an issue:

##### Are you asking a question?
Please don't file Github issues to ask questions. Use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-virtualized) (with a #react-virtualized tag) or the official [react-virtualized Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/bvaughn/react-virtualized).
Both of these areas are monitored by people other than me and so are likely to get faster responses. Question issues may be closed without a response.

##### Are you reporting a bug or runtime error?
Setting up a test case that demonstrates a bug can be difficult and time consuming. However this can often be a huge help and time saver for me. Since I maintain this library in my spare time and without any charges, I ask that you take the time to provide me with some way of reproducing the issue you are reporting. (Videos can be helpful but in most cases I will want to actually see a live demo and view your source code.)

You might find it useful to begin by forking one of the [playground](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/tree/master/playground) test projects when setting up your reproduction case. The online [Babel conversion tool](https://babeljs.io/repl/) is also quite helpful if you want to write ES6/ES7 syntax but export to something that runs in the browser via a `<script>` tag.

##### Are you making a feature request?
Provide as much information as possible about your requested feature. Here are a few questions you may consider answering:
* What's your use case? (Tell me about your application and what problem you're trying to solve.)
* What interface do you have in mind? (What new properties or methods do you think might be helpful?)
* Can you point to similar functionality with any existing libraries or components? (Working demos can be helpful.)
